This is a clone of the Google Homepage -- To put into use some snazzy HTML/CSS learnt in FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design course.

Details of what these snazzy things are will be updated here continuously until project completion.

This rounds off the Foundations > Front End segment of The Odin Project.

UPDATES:
- There weren't many opportunities to apply Accessible Design best practices besides image alt-text (maybe there'll be more in the follow-up challenge of building a Google Search Results page)
- Great practice for using Flexbox to implement a simple layout
- Ensured design / layout remains responsive across screen sizes
- Had fun figuring out how to replicate Google's rainbow avatar border
- Implemented CSS reset stylesheet for the first time (consciously)
- Played with composite shapes and transformation to create search icon and menu icon
- Learnt a trick for preventing buttons from moving when adding borders on hover
- Realised other languages in non-latin font do not display properly without setting charset
